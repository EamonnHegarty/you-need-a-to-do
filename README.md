# Backend Overview
The backend of You Need A To Do leverages the power of Node.js and Express to offer a robust web server environment. With the modularization of routes and middleware, the codebase remains easy to read and maintain. Key features include secure JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, customizable environment variables via dotenv, and a custom MongoDB database connection function. This setup ensures secure, scalable data storage, and efficient request handling.

# Frontend Overview
The frontend is built using React and enhances the user experience with Material UI components. Redux Toolkit and React-Redux provide efficient state management. Styling is achieved using the Emotion library, which allows for dynamic CSS-in-JS styles. Axios is used for HTTP requests, and the frontend includes libraries like date-fns and dayjs for date manipulation.
